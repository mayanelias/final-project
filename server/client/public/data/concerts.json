      "info": "Hace 22 años Monica Naranjo se enfrentó a un cruce de carreteras, podía seguir con los deseos de su discográfica y producir un disco como Palabra de Mujer o podía escuchar a la artista que llevaba dentro y producir el disco que ella quería y por el cual sería siempre recordada. Tras una dura lucha en el año 2000, Mónica saca a la venta su tercer disco, Minage, un gran tributo a la intérprete italiana Mina, logrando tres discos de platino en España y un disco de oro en México, convirtiéndose en uno de los discos más importantes en la historia del pop español. Ahora, dos décadas después y después de una triunfal gira por España, Mónica regresa al país que la vio nacer como artista y que la convirtió en uno de los referentes musicales por excelencia, para presentar su recital homónimo, PURO MINAGE, en el que solamente interpretará acompañada de la majestuosidad de un piano, las canciones de este inolvidable disco, en un concierto íntimo y muy especial",

      "info": "Under Southern Stars is an Australian patriotic song with lyrics written by former Australian immigration minister and Senator Amanda Vanstone. The song is set to the tune of the first of the Pomp and Circumstance Marches by Edward Elgar (or the same as the better-known song set to the same music Land of Hope and Glory).      Vanstone worked on the song for six years as a secret project, before releasing it in early 2007. She stated that the song came about after a discussion with some friends on Australia Day, where it was decided that Australia lacked a song with similar gravitas as the national anthem, Advance Australia Fair. She denied that the song was intended to replace or rival the national anthem, but could be played alongside it, and other classic and modern Australian patriotic songs such as Waltzing Matilda and True Blue at public events.",

The Colombian performer, composer, musician and producer, winner of the Latin Grammy 2020 and nominated for the American Grammy 2021, is an international reference that has more than five billion plays on all digital platforms around the world.  Gifted with impeccable songwriting skills and an intuitive sensibility, Camilo has conquered the music industry, critics, and audiences across generations, which has made him the Latin artist with the largest number of followers on TikTok: 21.6 million.  In addition, he has written songs for musical stars such as Becky G & Natti Natasha, Bomba Estéreo Mau & Ricky & Karol G, Sebastian Yatra & Mau & Ricky, as well as Bad Bunny, among many others.  Since his debut in 2019, the Medellín native has touched the hearts of millions of people with catchy songs and choruses that transmit good vibes, included in his two studio albums. Proof of this are the hits 'Tutu', 'Vida de rico', 'No te vayas', 'BEBÉ', 'Ropa cara' or 'KSI'.  After making the world fall in love with 'Indigo', the international artist presented 'Pesadilla', the second single from his anticipated new album that will be released in 2022. 'Pesadilla' was born out of his fascination for the Mexican roots sonority that has always inspired him and has been part of his life, while its lyrics explore the contrast of feelings about the loss of a love that only happened in a nightmare and the celebration that came upon awakening from it.",
